## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

DON'T delete this theme in the WP-Admin, you will lose your src files.

That's why we also recommend to use a VCS like Git.





## Setup WordPress theme

There are two essential files for a WordPress theme:

`style.css` file with a doctype like this:

```php
/*
Theme Name: wordpress-test
Theme URI: THEME SITE HERE
Author: YOUR NAME HERE
Author URI: YOUR SITE HERE
Description: THEME DESCRIPTION HERE
Version: 0.1.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags: YOUR TAGS HERE
Text Domain: wordpress-test
*/
```

`index.php` file with the basic template for your theme.

Add these 2 files in /src folder.
